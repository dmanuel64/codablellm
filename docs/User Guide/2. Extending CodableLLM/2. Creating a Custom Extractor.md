# 2. Creating a Custom Extractor

If you need to support a programming language not yet implemented by CodableLLM, you can easily extend the framework by creating your own custom extractor.

All custom extractors must subclass [`Extractor`](../../../documentation/codablellm/core/extractor/#codablellm.core.extractor.Extractor), an abstract base class that defined the interface for parsing source files and returning extracted functions.

## Methods to Implement

When extending [`Extractor`](../../../documentation/codablellm/core/extractor/#codablellm.core.extractor.Extractor), you must implement two methods:

1. [**`extract`**](../../../documentation/codablellm/core/extractor/#codablellm.core.extractor.Extractor.extract): Parses a given source code file and returns a sequence of [`SourceFunction`](../../../documentation/codablellm/core/function/#codablellm.core.function.SourceFunction) instances.
2. [**`get_extractable_files`**](../../../documentation/codablellm/core/extractor/#codablellm.core.extractor.Extractor.get_extractable_files): Given a directory or file path, returns all files that the extractor can process. This typically involves filtering by file extensions.

## Example: Creating a Custom Language Extractor

Below is a template for defining your own extractor. The implementation of each method will depend on how you choose to parse and extract functions for your language (e.g. using Tree-sitter, regex, or another parser).

### Creating Your Custom Extractor Class

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Sequence

from codablellm.core.extractor import Extractor
from codablellm.core.function import SourceFunction

class CustomLanguageExtractor(Extractor):
    '''
    Extractor for CustomLanguage source code files.
    '''

    def extract(self, file_path: Path | str, repo_path: Path | str | None = None) -> Sequence[SourceFunction]:
        # Implementation goes here: parse the file and return SourceFunction objects
        pass

    def get_extractable_files(self, path: Path | str) -> Sequence[Path]:
        # Implementation goes here: return a list of extractable source files (e.g., based on file extensions)
        pass
```

### Registering Your Custom Extractor

Once your extractor is implemented, you must register it with CodableLLM's extractor:

```python
from codablellm import extractor

extractor.add_extractor(
    'CustomLanguage',
        'classpath.to.CustomLanguageExtractor'  # Replace with your actual import path
)
```
